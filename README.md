- A prompt will appear asking for the node name. Enter a descriptive label for the node and press **OK**.

## **Positioning Node**

- Drag nodes to reposition them on the canvas to organize your mind map.

## **Editing Node Labels**

- Double-click on any node to edit its label.
- A prompt will appear allowing you to enter a new label. Press **OK** to apply the changes.

## Connecting Nodes

- To connect nodes, click and drag from the **handle** at the bottom of one node to the handle at the top of another node.
- Release the mouse to create a connection between the nodes.

## **Changing Background**

- Use the icons in the sidebar to change the visual layout of the mind map. Options include grids, lines, and dots.

## **Saving and Loading**
